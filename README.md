# Hiring-Salary-Prediction-Model
🚀 Predicting Salaries Using Machine Learning

I recently worked on a machine learning project where I built a Linear Regression model to help HR teams predict candidate salaries based on:

✅ Years of Experience
✅ Written Test Score (out of 10)
✅ Interview Score (out of 10)

🧠 #What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous value. In this case, we used it to understand how these three factors affect salary — and make future predictions with data-driven confidence.

🔍 #Objective
Build and train a model using historical hiring data to predict salaries

💻 #Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
